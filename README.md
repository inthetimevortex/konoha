# KONOHA

Some useful functions I found myself rewriting and copying all the time.

Includes
- constants: list of astrophysical constants in cgs
- be_theory: transforms W to omega, w, oblatness and back; gets T/T_MS from Hydrogen fractions and back
- binary_calculator: calculates some orbital parameters
- colormaper: some functions for creating colormaps
- dynamic: makes a dynamic spectra
- find_bisectors: tools for line profile analysis
- get_data: reads a bunch of fits file formats
- hpd: calculates the highest probability regions in a pdf
- linesDict: dictionary of useful astrophysical lines
- magtoflx: self explanatory
- plot_fullsed: plots fullsed outputs from HDUST
- pulsation: makes cool plots of pulsational regions in a sphere
- radial_velocity: functions that try to find the centre of line profiles
- sed_tools: Jansky to erg/s/cm2/micron, and vice-versa
- spec_norm: interactive spectra normalization
- sph_funcions: some functions I made for dealing with sph outputs. Not very up to date!
- utils: a bunch of useful functions, some translated to Python3 from pyhdust
- xdr_reader: reads and writes XDR files in the format used by the Interface
